### Section 301 tariffs. How to understand the Federal Registry.

#### Step 1: USTR website

Here: [https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/enforcement/section-301-investigations/tariff-actions](https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/enforcement/section-301-investigations/tariff-actions) is the website associated with the 301 investigation into China.

Now on this website are the different lists. The thing that is very frustrating is that it's not like there is just some Excel file with the list and tariff rate. To make matters even worse, this is not clear on the HTS website (the website with product codes and tarifs). So let me explain how this works:

First, there is this document:

[https://hts.usitc.gov/view/China%20Tariffs?release=2020HTSABasicB](https://hts.usitc.gov/view/China%20Tariffs?release=2020HTSABasicB)

which is essentially a master document of HS codes effected by the 301 investigation. The issue is how to map this information into somethig that we would understand. **Note** that this can be easily converted into excell (if you have Adobe DC) by simply cliking export as and select the Excel format. The output is pretty clean, only minor stuff needs to be done so it's machine readable.

Now this document has the following language:

"For reference, heading 9903.88.01 became effective on July 6, 2018, heading 9903.88.02 became effective on August 23, 2018, heading 9903.88.03 became effective on September 24, 2018, 9903.88.04 became effective on September 24, 2018, 9903.88.15 became effective on September 1, 2019, and 9903.88.16 is suspended pursuant to Federal Register notice of December 18, 2019 (84 FR 243)"

So this is how it is working. The Federal Registrar is publishing annexes undercertain headings, e.g. 9903.88.02. What is important, each one of these headings maps into a product code in the master document and the documents below describe the associated tariff rate and time of implementation.

 So here is the outline

- **9903.88.01** (Also known as the 34 of 60 billion list): This is the first list action that took place on July 6, 2018, described [here](https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/enforcement/section-301-investigations/section-301-china/34-billion-trade-action) then to see how this is mapped via the federal register open [this document outlining stuff](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2018-13248.pdf)

- **9903.88.02** (This is the next 16 billion list): This is the next action taking place on [August 23, 2018](https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/enforcement/section-301-investigations/section-301-china/16-billion-trade-action) and again mapped via the federal register [here](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/2018-17709.pdf)

- **9903.88.03, 9903.88.04** (This is the 200 billiion list): These two actions are taken together. Morover, this list is subject to futher actions. The first discussion is on [September 2018](https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/enforcement/section-301-investigations/section-301-china/200-billion-trade-action) and the initial action is the 10 percent under these two headings described [here](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/83%20FR%2047974.pdf). The website describes how things changed over time. The key change is that [here](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/84_FR_20459.pdf) for the June 2019 increase of these tariffs from 10 to 25 percent.

- **9903.88.15** (First part of the 300 billion list): This was the big list that would cover eveything and annouced [here](https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/enforcement/section-301-investigations/section-301-china/300-billion-trade-action). [Initially it was at 10 percent](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/Notice_of_Modification_%28List_4A_and_List_4B%29.pdf), but then went to [15 percent](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/Notice_of_Modification%E2%80%93August_2019.pdf) and implemented on Steptember 2019. These were then reduced to 7.5 percent](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/Notice_of_Modification-January_2020.pdf) on January 2020

- **9903.88.16** (Second part of the 300 billion list): This list was annouced with the ".15" list, but not to go into action untill December 18, 2019. See the back (page 141) of the [federal register notice](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/Notice_of_Modification_%28List_4A_and_List_4B%29.pdf). [It was eventually suspended and not put in place.](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/Notice_of_Modification%E2%80%93December_2019.pdf)
